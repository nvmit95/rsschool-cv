#### Hello! 

My name is Nikita. I am 26 years old and I am in the beggining of my career in IT as a Front-end developer.

I graduated from Institute of Parliamentarism and Entrepreneurship. 
I had been working by profession as an assistant of general accountant from 2016 till 2018, but then decided to change my life and job. I was always interested in computers and that is why I applied for a position of support specialist in Yandex.Taxi. I got this job and worked there for two years. 
At any difficult situation I can keep calm, think straight and find suitable solution. Also, I have a good written and verbal communication skills. 

I am kind, helpful and friendly person who enjoys working in a group. I think being part of a close-knit team that has one goal is very cool!
