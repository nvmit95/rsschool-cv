          <h2>Hello!</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Nikita. I am 26 years old and I am in the beggining of my
            career in IT as a Front-end developer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated from Institute of Parliamentarism and Entrepreneurship.
            I had been working by profession as an assistant of general
            accountant from 2016 till 2018, but then decided to change my life
            and job. I was always interested in computers and that is why I
            applied for a position of support specialist in Yandex.Taxi. I got
            this job and worked there for two years. At any difficult situation
            I can keep calm, think straight and find suitable solution. Also, I
            have a good written and verbal communication skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am kind, helpful and friendly person who enjoys working in a
            group. I think being part of a close-knit team that has one goal is
            very cool!
